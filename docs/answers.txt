4)    Branches are a way to logically divide up work and they do not take up additional storage or memory.


5)    git log shows the commit history, while git status does not. 


6)    git log Vehicle.h


7)    git log -all --grep='file'


8)    Inheritance occurs when newly created classes inherit attributes and methods from existing classes.
      Polymorphism is when a method is defined for different objects and can be implemented in its own way.
      Encapsulation is hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and access is only allowed through public methods.


9)    In Integration Manager, each developer makes pushes to their own public repository and pull from the central repository.
      In Dictator and Lieutenants, only the dictator can make pushes to the repository.


10)   All changes made by the 100 developers are merged together by the Lieutenant and then merged again by the Dictator before
being pushed to the public repository. This will keep things more streamlined with one leader managing code from 100 developers.
